# Why Use Kubernetes (K8s)?

Kubernetes is a platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## Benefits of Kubernetes

- **Automated Scaling:** 
  - K8s can automatically adjust the number of containers based on the demand, ensuring efficient use of resources.
  
- **Self-healing Capabilities:**
  - It can automatically replace failed containers, reschedule, and even restart them, which enhances reliability and uptime.
  
- **Load Balancing:**
  - Kubernetes can automatically distribute network traffic to ensure stability during high-traffic periods.

- **Multi-Cloud and Cross-Cloud Support:**
  - K8s can run on various cloud platforms, showing its flexibility and avoiding vendor lock-in.

## When Not to Use Kubernetes

- **Small-Scale Projects:**
  - For smaller projects or applications, Kubernetes might be overkill. Simpler container management tools might be more suitable.
  
- **Limited Expertise:**
  - If the team lacks expertise in Kubernetes, it might be challenging to implement and maintain effectively.
  
- **Cost Concerns:**
  - Kubernetes can be resource-intensive, it might not be the most economical choice.
